# NiGEL Technical Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation for NiGEL, a conversational AI assistant with the persona of Nigel Thornberry.

## Project Overview

NiGEL is a Python desktop application that provides a chat interface to interact with a generative AI model from Google's Gemini family. The application is designed to be a friendly and knowledgeable assistant with a unique and engaging personality.

The application runs in the system tray and can be activated by clicking on its icon. This opens a dropdown window with a chat interface where users can have a conversation with NiGEL.

## Key Features

*   **Conversational AI:** Powered by Google's Gemini Pro, NiGEL can understand and respond to a wide range of questions and prompts.
*   **Engaging Persona:** NiGEL has a distinct personality inspired by Nigel Thornberry, making interactions more entertaining and memorable.
*   **System Tray Integration:** The application lives in the system tray, providing easy access without cluttering the desktop.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with PyQt6, NiGEL can be packaged to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Stateful Persona:** NiGEL's personality and conversation history are saved to a JSON file, allowing the AI to learn and evolve over time.
