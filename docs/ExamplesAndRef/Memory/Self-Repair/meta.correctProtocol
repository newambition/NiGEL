# The Self-Correction Protocol

**When to use this protocol:**
Need a system that can identify and address its own errors and limitations? This protocol establishes frameworks for autonomous error detection and correctionâ€”perfect for quality assurance, error reduction, limitation management, or progressive accuracy improvement.

```
Prompt: I need to develop a financial forecasting system that can identify its own prediction errors, understand the patterns and causes of those errors, and progressively improve its accuracy through self-correction mechanisms. The system should be able to detect when it's operating outside its reliability boundaries and adjust its confidence levels accordingly. It needs to continuously refine its forecasting approaches based on performance data.
